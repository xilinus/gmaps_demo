Sample Rails 2.0 Application to show how to use GoogleMaps.
This application has been written in live in RailsCamps Paris 2008

It uses two plugins
- restful_authentication used to generate quickly users views/controller
- geokit to add geo finder in user model

To install it:
# To get source
git clone git://github.com/xilinus/gmaps_demo.git

# To get submodules (plugins)
git submodule init  
git submodule update

# By default database.yml is set on mysql, edit it if you want to use another database
# To generate create database and fill some data
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:fixtures:load

# Start webserver
./script/server

The googlemap key is set to localhost, so open your browser on http://localhost:3000/
If you want ot chnage it, go to google http://code.google.com/apis/maps/ and update layout files.

That's it 

:)
